# Stripe Payment Infrastructure - Setup Guide

## Overview

This document describes the complete Stripe payment infrastructure for the Refund Finder application. The system collects a $49 upfront payment (tax-inclusive) from users and provides a 100% refund guarantee if we're unable to successfully file their claim.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Frontend Components**
   - `ClaimSubmissionForm.tsx` - 5-step form with integrated payment
   - `PaymentStep.tsx` - Stripe payment UI with card element
   - `StripeProvider.tsx` - Stripe Elements wrapper

2. **Backend API Endpoints**
   - `/api/create-payment-intent` - Creates Stripe Payment Intent
   - `/api/create-claim` - Processes claim with payment verification
   - `/api/process-refund` - Issues refunds (manual/automatic)
   - `/api/webhooks/stripe` - Handles Stripe webhook events

3. **Database Layer (Airtable)**
   - Claims table - Stores claim information
   - Payments table - Tracks payment status
   - Refunds table - Logs refund transactions

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Stripe Keys (Test Mode)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  # Generated after webhook setup

# Service Configuration
SERVICE_FEE_AMOUNT=4900  # $49.00 in cents
SERVICE_FEE_CURRENCY=usd
CLAIM_PROCESSING_DEADLINE_DAYS=10

# Airtable (when ready)
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id
```

## Refund System

### Automatic Refund Triggers

Refunds are issued automatically when:
1. Claim is marked as "rejected" by airline
2. Claim is not filed within 10 business days (configurable)

### Manual Refund Process

For manual refunds (support requests):

```bash
POST /api/process-refund
{
  "claimId": "claim-123456",
  "reason": "requested_by_customer",
  "processedBy": "support@example.com",
  "internalNotes": "Customer requested refund"
}
```

### Check Refund Eligibility

```bash
GET /api/process-refund?claimId=claim-123456
```

Response:
```json
{
  "eligible": true,
  "claimStatus": "rejected",
  "paymentStatus": "succeeded",
  "amount": 4900,
  "currency": "usd",
  "reason": "Claim is eligible for refund"
}
```

## Webhook Setup

### 1. Configure Webhook in Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Enter URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Select events to listen to:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `charge.refunded`
   - `refund.created`
   - `refund.updated`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret
6. Add to `.env.local` as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 2. Test Webhook Locally

For local development, use Stripe CLI:

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login to Stripe
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Test webhook
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
```

# Process refund
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/process-refund \
