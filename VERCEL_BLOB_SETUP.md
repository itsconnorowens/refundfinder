# Vercel Blob File Storage Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What's Been Implemented

### âœ… Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/blob` package for file storage

### âœ… Environment Configuration
- Added `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` to `.env.local.example`
- You'll need to get your token from: https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores

### âœ… API Route for File Uploads
- Created `/api/upload-file/route.ts` for handling file uploads
- Supports PDF, JPG, PNG files up to 5MB
- Files are organized by type (boardingPass/delayProof) with timestamps
- Returns public URLs for uploaded files

### âœ… Updated Claim Submission Form
- Files now upload to Vercel Blob immediately when selected
- Shows upload progress with loading indicators
- Displays "âœ“ Uploaded" badge when files are successfully stored
- Form submission now sends URLs instead of file objects

### âœ… Updated API Integration
- Modified `/api/create-claim/route.ts` to accept JSON with file URLs
- Updated Airtable schema to store `boarding_pass_url` and `delay_proof_url`
- Removed local file storage dependencies

## Next Steps

### 1. Get Your Vercel Blob Token
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores
2. Create a new Blob store (or use existing)
3. Copy the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
4. Add it to your `.env.local` file

### 2. Test the Implementation
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then test the file upload flow:
1. Go to `/claim` page
2. Fill out the form
3. Upload files in Step 3
4. Verify files upload successfully
5. Complete the payment flow

### 3. Verify in Vercel Dashboard
- Check your Blob store to see uploaded files
- Files should be organized in folders: `boardingPass/` and `delayProof/`

## Fallback Strategy
As mentioned in your PRD, if Vercel Blob fails:
- Users can email attachments to ops@[domain]
- Store email file links in Airtable
- Manual processing workflow

Your file storage is now ready for production! ðŸš€
