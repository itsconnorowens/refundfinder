# Payment System Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started in 5 Minutes

### 1. Environment Setup

Your `.env.local` already has test Stripe keys configured. No changes needed for development!

```bash
✅ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51SMGzCBm8UEEGTfq...
✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51SMGzCBm8UEEGTfq...
✅ SERVICE_FEE_AMOUNT=4900 ($49.00)
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Already done! ✅ Stripe packages installed:
- `stripe` - Server SDK
- `@stripe/stripe-js` - Frontend SDK  
- `@stripe/react-stripe-js` - React components

### 3. Test the Payment Flow

Start your dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to the claim form and:
1. Fill out steps 1-4 (personal info, flight details, documents, review)
2. Click "Continue" to payment step
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
5. CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
6. Click "Pay $49.00"
7. ✅ Claim submitted successfully!

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test Payment Success

- [ ] Verify payment processes successfully
- [ ] Confirm claim submitted with payment reference
- [ ] Check Stripe Dashboard for payment

### Test Payment Failure
- [ ] Use declined card `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- [ ] Verify error message displays
- [ ] Confirm claim NOT submitted
- [ ] User can retry with different card

### Test Refund (Manual)
```bash
# Get claim ID from submission
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/process-refund \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "claimId": "claim-XXXXXXXX",
    "reason": "claim_unsuccessful"
  }'
```

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Check Payment Status
```typescript
import { retrievePaymentIntent } from '@/lib/stripe-server';

const payment = await retrievePaymentIntent('pi_xxx');
console.log(payment.status); // 'succeeded', 'failed', etc.
```

### Issue Refund
```typescript
import { processRefund } from '@/lib/stripe-server';

const refund = await processRefund('pi_xxx', 'requested_by_customer');
console.log(refund.status); // 'succeeded'
```

### Query Airtable
```typescript
import { getClaimByClaimId } from '@/lib/airtable';

const claim = await getClaimByClaimId('claim-123');
console.log(claim.get('Status'));
```

## 📊 Airtable Setup (When Ready)

1. Create Airtable base with 3 tables: Claims, Payments, Refunds
2. Follow `AIRTABLE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
3. Add credentials to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   AIRTABLE_API_KEY=patXXXXXX
   AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appXXXXXX
   ```
4. Test with: `npm run test:airtable`

For now, the app works without Airtable (logs to console).

## 🌐 Webhook Setup (For Production)

### Local Testing with Stripe CLI

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local dev
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Copy webhook secret to .env.local
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
```

### Production Setup

1. Deploy to Vercel (automatically happens on git push)
2. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
3. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Select events: `payment_intent.*`, `charge.refunded`, `refund.*`
5. Copy webhook secret
6. Add to Vercel environment variables

## 💡 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Airtable not configured" warning
**Fix**: This is expected during development. The app still works!
- Payment data logged to console
- Add Airtable credentials when ready

### Payment Intent creation fails
**Check**:
1. Is `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in `.env.local`?
2. Did you restart dev server after adding keys?
3. Check browser console for errors

### Webhook not working
**Check**:
1. Is `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` configured?
2. Are you using Stripe CLI for local dev?
3. Check webhook logs in Stripe Dashboard

### Payment succeeds but claim not saved
**Check**:
1. Check server logs for errors
2. Verify Airtable credentials (if configured)
3. Payment is captured - can issue refund if needed
