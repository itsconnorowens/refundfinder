# Project Path Safeguards

This document outlines the safeguards in place to prevent confusion between different projects and ensure we're always working in the correct directory.

## The Problem

Previously, there was confusion between:
- ❌ `/Users/connorowens/Desktop/clientcompass/flghtly` (incorrect)
- ✅ `/Users/connorowens/Desktop/flghtly` (correct)

This led to commands being run in the wrong directory and potential data loss or confusion.

## The Solution

### 1. Path Validation Script

A validation script has been created at `scripts/validate-project-path.js` that:
- Verifies we're in the correct project directory (`flghtly`)
- Checks the absolute path matches expectations
- Validates the presence of `package.json`
- Confirms the package name matches the project

### 2. NPM Script

A convenient npm script has been added:
```bash
npm run validate-path
```

This can be run anytime to verify you're in the correct project directory.

### 3. Memory Bank

The project memory bank has been updated to:
- Remove any references to `clientcompass`
- Clearly document the correct project path
- Prevent future confusion

## Usage

### Before Starting Work
Always run the validation script before starting work:
```bash
npm run validate-path
```

### If You're in the Wrong Directory
If the validation fails, navigate to the correct directory:
```bash
cd /Users/connorowens/Desktop/flghtly
```

### IDE Configuration
Make sure your IDE/editor is opened to the correct directory:
- ✅ `/Users/connorowens/Desktop/flghtly`
- ❌ `/Users/connorowens/Desktop/clientcompass/flghtly`

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always use the validation script before starting work
2. Double-check the current working directory with `pwd`
3. Ensure your IDE is opened to the correct project root
4. Use relative paths in scripts when possible
5. Avoid hardcoding absolute paths in configuration files

## Project Structure

The correct project structure is:
```
/Users/connorowens/Desktop/flghtly/
├── src/
├── scripts/
│   └── validate-project-path.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── ... (other project files)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter path-related issues:
1. Run `npm run validate-path` to check your current location
2. Verify you're in `/Users/connorowens/Desktop/flghtly`
3. Check that `package.json` exists and contains `"name": "flghtly"`
4. Ensure no hardcoded paths reference the old `clientcompass` directory
