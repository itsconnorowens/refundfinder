# Refund Finder - Comprehensive Codebase Evaluation

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**PRD Version**: 1.1 (Updated October 25, 2025)  
**Evaluation Type**: Comprehensive Assessment Against PRD Goals

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Status: **60% MVP Complete** ‚ö†Ô∏è

The codebase has made significant progress on the visual/UI layer and infrastructure but is **missing critical MVP features** required for launch. The project has excellent animations, payment processing, and claim submission‚Äîbut lacks the core **eligibility checker**, **email parsing**, and **results flow** that form the foundation of the user experience.

### Key Findings

‚úÖ **What's Working Well**:
- Payment integration (Stripe) is complete and tested
- Claim submission form is comprehensive and polished
- Airtable integration is robust with proper error handling
- Beautiful UI with advanced animations (flight paths, hero sections)
- Testing infrastructure in place (Vitest, Playwright)
- Documentation is extensive and well-organized

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Gaps**:
- **NO eligibility checker page or logic** (core MVP feature)
- **NO results page** to show eligibility outcomes
- **NO manual entry form** as fallback to email parsing
- **NO rate limiting** on eligibility checks
- **NO Terms of Service or Privacy Policy pages**
- Email parsing exists but not integrated into user flow

‚ùå **What Needs Fixing**:
- Landing page jumps straight to claim form (should start with eligibility check)
- Missing multi-step onboarding flow from PRD
- No success page after payment/submission
- Stripe webhook handler not fully implemented
- Missing refund automation logic

---

## Detailed Assessment by PRD Feature

### 1. Landing Page ‚úÖ **80% Complete**

**PRD Requirements**:
- Hero section with email paste textarea
- Manual entry form as alternative
- "How It Works" section (3 steps)
- FAQs (5 questions)
- Social proof
- CTA buttons

**What's Built**:
- ‚úÖ Beautiful hero section with animation
- ‚úÖ "How It Works" section with 3 steps
- ‚úÖ FAQs with 5 questions (accordion UI)
- ‚úÖ CTA section at bottom
- ‚úÖ Responsive design

**What's Missing**:
- ‚ùå No eligibility input form on landing page
- ‚ùå No textarea for pasting flight confirmation email
- ‚ùå No "Check Eligibility" button triggering eligibility check
- ‚ùå Social proof is placeholder text (no real stats)
- ‚ùå CTA buttons scroll to top instead of starting eligibility check

**Recommendation**: The landing page is visually complete but functionally disconnected. Need to add eligibility checker form to hero section.

---

### 2. Eligibility Checker ‚ùå **0% Complete** (CRITICAL)

**PRD Requirements**:
- Email paste option with Claude AI parsing
- Manual entry fallback form
- Eligibility rules engine (EU261 + US DOT)
- Results page showing outcome
- Store all checks in Airtable
- Rate limiting (10 requests/IP/hour)

**What's Built**:
- ‚úÖ `parseFlightEmail()` function exists and works
- ‚úÖ Claude AI integration functional
- ‚úÖ API route `/api/parse-flight-email` exists
- ‚ùå No eligibility checker page
- ‚ùå No eligibility logic implementation
- ‚ùå No results page
- ‚ùå No rate limiting
- ‚ùå Not connected to landing page
- ‚ùå No Eligibility_Checks table integration

**Impact**: This is the **MOST CRITICAL GAP**. The MVP flow is:
```
Landing ‚Üí Eligibility Check ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Claim Form ‚Üí Payment
```

Currently, users skip directly to claim form without knowing if they're eligible. This violates the PRD's core experience.

**Files Needed**:
1. `src/app/check-eligibility/page.tsx` - Eligibility checker form page
2. `src/app/results/page.tsx` - Results display page
3. `src/lib/eligibility.ts` - Eligibility rules engine
4. `src/app/api/check-eligibility/route.ts` - API endpoint
5. `src/components/EligibilityForm.tsx` - Form component

---

### 3. Claim Submission Form ‚úÖ **95% Complete**

**PRD Requirements**:
- Multi-step form (Personal Info ‚Üí Flight Details ‚Üí Documentation ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Payment)
- Progress bar

**What's Built**:
- ‚úÖ Complete 5-step form with progress bar
- ‚úÖ Personal info collection (name, email)
- ‚úÖ Flight details form
- ‚úÖ File upload with drag-and-drop
- ‚úÖ Review step before payment
- ‚úÖ localStorage persistence
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive validation
- ‚úÖ Mobile-responsive
- ‚úÖ Excellent UX with error handling

**What's Missing**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è File storage uses local filesystem (`uploads/` directory) instead of Vercel Blob
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No fallback instructions if upload fails (PRD requires email alternative)
- ‚úÖ Payment integration complete

**Recommendation**: Migrate file storage to Vercel Blob Storage (as specified in PRD) and add upload failure fallback messaging.

---

### 4. Payment Flow ‚úÖ **85% Complete**

**PRD Requirements**:

- ‚úÖ Payment verification before claim submission
- ‚úÖ Metadata tracking (claimId, email, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Stripe webhook route exists (`/api/webhooks/stripe`)
- ‚úÖ Refund processing functions

**What's Missing**:
- ‚ùå Success page (`/success`) not created
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Webhook handler needs completion (update claim status in Airtable)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No confirmation email trigger after payment

**Recommendation**: Create success page and complete webhook integration to update claim status and trigger confirmation email.

---

### 5. Email/Notifications ‚ùå **0% Complete**

**PRD Requirements**:

---

## Conclusion

### The Good News ‚úÖ

The codebase demonstrates **high-quality engineering**:
- Clean TypeScript code
- Professional UI/UX
- Solid architecture choices
- Good error handling
- Performance optimizations

The payment processing and data layer are **production-ready**. The UI is **exceptional** and exceeds MVP requirements.

### The Reality Check ‚ö†Ô∏è

The project is **60% complete** but is **missing the core user experience**:
- No way to check eligibility (the main value prop!)
- No results page (users don't know if they qualify)
- No success confirmation (poor post-purchase experience)

### The Path Forward üöÄ

With **23 hours of focused work** (~3-4 days), you can:
1. Complete the missing user journey
2. Add essential features (rate limiting, webhooks)
3. Prepare for launch (legal pages, testing)

The foundation is solid. The gaps are clear. The effort is manageable.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize the 6 P0 items this week, then launch. Add P1 items in week 2 based on early user feedback.
