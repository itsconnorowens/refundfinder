# Automated Refund System

This document describes the comprehensive automated refund system implemented for Flghtly, including monitoring, analytics, and customer notifications.

## Overview

The automated refund system provides:
- **Automatic refund processing** based on configurable triggers
- **Real-time monitoring** and alerting for refund rates
- **Analytics dashboard** for tracking refund performance
- **Customer notifications** for refund events
- **Admin management** interface for oversight

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Automated Refund Engine** (`src/lib/automated-refund.ts`)
   - Analyzes claims for refund eligibility
   - Processes automatic refunds via Stripe
   - Handles batch refund operations

2. **Refund Analytics** (`src/lib/refund-analytics.ts`)
   - Calculates refund metrics and trends
   - Generates alerts for unusual patterns
   - Provides performance recommendations

3. **Customer Notifications** (`src/lib/refund-notifications.ts`)
   - Sends email notifications for refund events
   - Templates for different refund scenarios
   - Batch notification processing

4. **Admin Dashboard** (`src/app/admin/refunds/page.tsx`)
   - Real-time refund analytics
   - Alert management
   - Performance monitoring

## Refund Triggers

The system automatically processes refunds for the following scenarios:

### Automatic Triggers
- **Claim Not Filed Deadline**: Claims not filed within 48 hours
- **Claim Rejected by Airline**: Claims rejected due to airline decision
- **Insufficient Documentation**: Missing required documents
- **Ineligible Flight**: Flights not eligible for compensation
- **System Error**: Technical errors preventing claim processing
- **Duplicate Claim**: Duplicate claims detected

### Manual Triggers
- **Customer Request**: Customer-initiated refunds within 24 hours
- **Admin Override**: Manual refund processing by administrators

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_...

# Email Notifications (Optional)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...

# Cron Job Security
CRON_SECRET=your-secret-key

# Airtable Configuration
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=key...
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app...
```

### Refund Configuration
```typescript
export const REFUND_CONFIG = {
  CLAIM_FILING_DEADLINE_HOURS: 48,
  CUSTOMER_REQUEST_DEADLINE_HOURS: 24,
  HIGH_REFUND_RATE_THRESHOLD: 25, // 25%
  DAILY_REFUND_LIMIT: 100,
};
```

## API Endpoints

### Automated Refund Processing
- `POST /api/automated-refund/process` - Process single refund
- `GET /api/automated-refund/analyze` - Analyze refund eligibility
- `PUT /api/automated-refund/batch` - Process batch refunds

### Analytics & Monitoring
- `GET /api/refund-analytics/dashboard` - Get dashboard data
- `GET /api/refund-analytics/performance` - Get performance metrics
- `GET /api/refund-analytics/alerts` - Get current alerts
- `POST /api/refund-analytics/alerts/acknowledge` - Acknowledge alert

### Cron Jobs
- `POST /api/cron/process-automatic-refunds` - Automated refund processing
- `GET /api/cron/process-automatic-refunds` - Health check

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Alert Types
- **High Refund Rate**: Refund rate exceeds threshold
- **Unusual Pattern**: Statistical anomaly detected
- **System Error**: Technical issues preventing processing
- **Threshold Exceeded**: Daily limits exceeded

### Alert Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate attention required
- **High**: Urgent action needed
- **Medium**: Monitor closely
- **Low**: Informational

## Customer Notifications

### Email Templates
- **Automatic Refund**: When system processes automatic refund
- **Manual Refund**: When customer requests refund
- **Refund Processed**: When refund completes

### Notification Triggers
- Refund processed automatically
- Customer refund request approved
- Refund completed and visible in account

## Admin Dashboard

### Key Metrics
- Refund rate percentage
- Net revenue after refunds
- Average refund processing time
- Total claims processed

### Analytics Views
- **Overview**: High-level metrics and trends
- **Refund Triggers**: Breakdown by trigger type
- **Performance**: Detailed performance analysis

### Alert Management
- View active alerts
- Acknowledge alerts
- Monitor alert trends

## Cron Job Configuration

### Vercel Cron Jobs
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/process-automatic-refunds",
      "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Manual Triggering
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/process-automatic-refunds \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret"
```

## Database Schema

### Refund Records
- `refund_id`: Unique identifier
- `payment_id`: Reference to payment
- `claim_id`: Reference to claim
- `stripe_refund_id`: Stripe refund ID
- `amount`: Refund amount in cents
- `reason`: Refund reason
- `status`: Processing status
- `processed_by`: Who processed the refund
- `created_at`: Timestamp

### Analytics Data
- Period-based metrics
- Trigger-based breakdowns
- Time-series data
- Performance indicators

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Cron jobs require secret token
- Admin dashboard requires authentication
- API endpoints validate permissions

### Data Protection
- Customer data encrypted in transit
- Refund records audit trail
- Secure Stripe integration

### Rate Limiting
- Batch processing limits
- API rate limiting
- Email sending limits

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Email failures don't block refunds
- Airtable failures logged but don't stop processing
- Stripe errors handled with retry logic

### Monitoring
- All errors logged with context
- Failed operations tracked
- Alert generation for critical errors

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Processing
- Process refunds in batches of 5
- Rate limiting between batches
- Parallel processing where possible

### Caching
- Analytics data cached
- Dashboard data refreshed periodically
- Alert status cached

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Refund eligibility analysis
- Analytics calculations
- Email template rendering

### Integration Tests
- Stripe refund processing
- Airtable record updates
- Email delivery

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete refund workflow
- Dashboard functionality
- Alert generation

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Stripe account configured
- Airtable base set up
- Resend account (optional)
- Vercel deployment

### Environment Setup
