ClientCompass references have been completely removed from the refundfinder project:

1. Updated memory-bank/project-path to remove clientcompass reference
2. Created validation script at scripts/validate-project-path.js
3. Added npm script "validate-path" for easy validation
4. Created PROJECT_PATH_SAFEGUARDS.md documentation
5. Verified no hardcoded paths exist in configuration files

The project is now completely independent and has safeguards to prevent future path confusion.
