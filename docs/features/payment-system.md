# Payment System

**CRITICAL UPDATE (2025-01-31):** This document has been completely rewritten to reflect the actual production payment flow discovered during implementation. Previous version documented an unused 6-step form flow.

**Implementation Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Production-ready with post-payment document collection ✅
**Last Major Update:** Session discovery of homepage eligibility checker as primary flow

---

## Executive Summary

### What We Discovered

During implementation, we discovered that **users are NOT using the 6-step ClaimSubmissionForm**. Instead, they're using the **homepage eligibility checker** (FlightLookupForm →  EligibilityResults → PaymentForm), which is a much simpler, more streamlined flow.

### Key Changes Made

1. **Fixed Data Flow:** Payment form was using hardcoded placeholder data ("John Doe", "user@example.com"). Now uses real user data from eligibility checker.

2. **Post-Payment Document Collection:** Instead of collecting documents before payment, we now:
   - Collect minimal info before payment (flight details, personal info)
   - Process payment immediately
   - Redirect to document upload page
   - Allow users to skip documents ("I'll email later")

3. **Strategic Pivot:** Aligned with competitive best practices (AirHelp, ClaimCompass):
   - Minimal friction before payment
   - Speed as differentiator (48h filing guarantee)
   - Bank details collected AFTER airline approves (4-8 weeks later)

### What Works Now

✅ Users pay $49 with real data (not placeholders)
✅ Payment succeeds → Redirects to document upload
✅ Documents uploaded → Claim created in Airtable
✅ Duplicate payment prevention
✅ Comprehensive error handling
✅ Idempotency keys prevent double charges

## Actual Production Flow

### User Journey (As Implemented)

```
Homepage (flghtly.com)
   ↓
[Eligibility Checker Form]
- Flight number, airline, date
- Departure/arrival airports
- Disruption type (delay/cancellation/etc.)
- Delay duration
- Passenger name, email
   ↓
[Eligibility Results]
- Shows compensation estimate (e.g., "Up to €270")
- "Proceed with Claim - $49" button
   ↓
[Payment Form Appears (inline)]
- Stripe card element
- Trust signals (100% money-back guarantee)
- Real user data passed to Stripe ✅
   ↓

   ↓
[Redirect to Document Upload]
- URL: /claim/FL-XXXXXX/documents
- Upload boarding pass (required)
- Upload delay proof (optional)
- Add booking reference (optional)
- Option: "I'll email these later"
   ↓
[Documents Uploaded]
- Files saved (currently local, needs cloud storage)
- Claim created in Airtable
- All user data + flight data + documents
   ↓
[Success Page]
- Shows claim ID
- Timeline of next steps
- Track claim link
- Confirmation email (when implemented)
```

### Data Collection Strategy

Based on competitive analysis (AirHelp best practices):

**Phase 1: Pre-Payment (Minimal Friction)**
- ✅ Personal info (name, email)
- ✅ Flight details (number, airline, date, route)
- ✅ Disruption type and details
- ✅ Delay duration

**Phase 2: Post-Payment (Required Documents)**
- ✅ Boarding pass (required, but can email later)
- ⚠️ Delay proof (optional - we have API verification)
- ⚠️ Booking reference (optional but helpful)

**Phase 3: After Claim Approval (4-8 weeks)**
- ❌ Bank details (NOT collected during payment flow)
- ❌ Passport (only if required by airline)

**Never Ask For:**
- ❌ Exact flight times (inferred from API)
- ❌ Credit card storage (Stripe handles)
- ❌ Password/account creation (claim ID only)

---

## Architecture

### Component Flow

```typescript
// Homepage: src/app/page.tsx
FlightLookupForm
   ↓ (passes formData + results)
EligibilityResults
   ↓ (passes formData + eligibilityData)
PaymentForm
   ↓ (creates Payment Intent with all data)
Stripe Payment
   ↓ (on success, redirect to documents)
DocumentUploadPage (/claim/[claimId]/documents)
   ↓ (upload files, finalize claim)
SuccessPage (/success?claimId=XXX)
```

### Data Flow (Current Implementation)

```typescript
// Step 1: User fills eligibility form
FlightLookupForm.handleSubmit() {
  // Calls /api/check-eligibility
  const result = await checkEligibility(formData);

  // CRITICAL: Passes BOTH results AND formData up
  onResults(result, formData);
}

// Step 2: Parent stores data
HomePage {
  const [results, setResults] = useState(null);
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState(null);

  const handleResults = (response, userData) => {
    setResults(response);
    setFormData(userData); // Store user data
  }

  return <EligibilityResults results={results} formData={formData} />
}

// Step 3: EligibilityResults passes to PaymentForm
EligibilityResults {
  return (
    <PaymentForm
      formData={formData}              // All user input
      eligibilityResults={results.data} // API verification
      onSuccess={...}
      onCancel={...}
    />
  );
}

// Step 4: PaymentForm sends to Stripe
PaymentForm.handleSubmit() {
  const claimId = `FL-${Date.now()}-${randomString}`;

  // Create Payment Intent with ALL data
  const response = await fetch('/api/create-payment-intent', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      email: formData.passengerEmail,    // Real email ✅
      firstName: formData.firstName,      // Real name ✅
      lastName: formData.lastName,        // Real name ✅
      claimId,                           // Consistent ID
      currency,
      formData,                          // ALL form data
      flightData: eligibilityResults.flightData,
      eligibilityData: eligibilityResults.eligibility,
      disruptionType: formData.disruptionType,
    }),
  });

  // Payment succeeds → Redirect
  router.push(`/claim/${claimId}/documents?paymentIntentId=${paymentIntentId}`);
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### `/api/create-payment-intent` (Updated)

**Purpose:** Creates Stripe Payment Intent with comprehensive metadata

**Key Changes:**
- Now accepts `formData`, `flightData`, `eligibilityData`
- Stores everything in Payment Intent metadata
- Uses client-provided claim ID for consistency
- Supports idempotency keys to prevent duplicates

```typescript
// Metadata stored in Stripe (limited to 500 chars per field)
metadata: {
  claimId,
  email,
  firstName,
  lastName,
  currency,
  disruptionType,
  flightNumber,
  departureAirport,
  arrivalAirport,
  departureDate,
  airline,
  delayHours,
  delayMinutes,
}
```

#### `/api/upload-documents` (New)

**Purpose:** Handles file uploads after payment

**Request:**
```typescript
FormData {
  claimId: string;
  boardingPass: File;
  delayProof?: File;
  bookingReference?: string;
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  documentUrls: {
    boardingPassUrl: '/uploads/FL-123_boarding_pass.pdf',
    delayProofUrl: '/uploads/FL-123_delay_proof.jpg'
  }
}
```

**Current Implementation:**
- Saves files to `public/uploads/` (development)
- Updates Airtable claim record with URLs
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Replace with cloud storage (S3/Cloudflare R2)

#### `/api/finalize-claim` (New)

**Purpose:** Creates final claim record after documents uploaded

**Process:**
1. Retrieves Payment Intent from Stripe (has all user data in metadata)
2. Verifies payment succeeded
3. Calls `/api/create-claim` with complete data
4. Handles errors gracefully (claim can be created manually if needed)

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  claimId: string;
  paymentIntentId: string;
  boardingPassUrl?: string;
  delayProofUrl?: string;
  bookingReference?: string;
}
```

- Review error tracking (Sentry)

**Weekly:**
- Check for pending documents (not uploaded after 48h)
- Review refund requests
- Monitor payment success rate
- Check customer feedback

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Payment successful but no redirect"

**Symptoms:** User pays, button shows "Processing", nothing happens

**Cause:** Payment success handler not redirecting properly

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check browser console for errors
console.log('Payment succeeded:', result.paymentIntent);
console.log('Redirecting to:', `/claim/${claimId}/documents`);
```

**Fix:**
- Verify `router.push()` is called in PaymentForm
- Check claim ID is generated correctly
- Ensure no JavaScript errors blocking redirect

---

### "Payment uses placeholder data"

**Symptoms:** Stripe dashboard shows "John Doe" or "user@example.com"

**Cause:** formData not passed correctly through components

**Debug:**
```typescript
// In PaymentForm, check props
console.log('formData received:', formData);
console.log('Email:', formData?.passengerEmail);

// In create-payment-intent API
console.log('Request body:', body);
```

**Fix:**
1. Verify FlightLookupForm calls `onResults(result, formData)`
2. Verify page.tsx stores formData in state
3. Verify EligibilityResults passes formData to PaymentForm
4. Check PaymentForm sends formData in API request

---

### "Duplicate payments charged"

**Symptoms:** User charged multiple times for same claim

**Cause:** Duplicate click or idempotency key not working

**Debug:**
```typescript
// Check Stripe Dashboard → Payments
// Look for multiple payments with same metadata

// Check hasSubmitted state
console.log('hasSubmitted:', hasSubmitted);
console.log('loading:', loading);
```

**Fix:**
- Verify `hasSubmitted` state prevents double-clicks
- Verify idempotency key passed to Stripe
- Check for JavaScript errors preventing state updates

---

### "Documents not uploading"

**Symptoms:** File upload fails or returns error

**Cause:** File size too large, invalid file type, or API error

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check browser console
# Check Network tab for /api/upload-documents response

# Check server logs
tail -f /var/log/vercel.log
```

**Common Issues:**
- File size > 10MB
- File type not PDF/JPG/PNG
- Directory permissions (development)
- Cloud storage credentials (production)

---

## Key Learnings from Session

### Discovery: Wrong Flow Documented

**Previous assumption:** Users complete 6-step ClaimSubmissionForm before payment

**Reality:** Users use homepage eligibility checker → immediate payment → post-payment documents

**Impact:** Complete rewrite of payment system documentation needed

### Discovery: Placeholder Data Bug

**Previous state:** PaymentForm hardcoded "John Doe" and "user@example.com"

**Root cause:** Data flow broken between components

**Fix:** Thread formData through FlightLookupForm → page.tsx → EligibilityResults → PaymentForm

### Strategic Pivot: Document Collection Timing

**Previous approach:** Collect documents before payment

**Competitive analysis:** AirHelp, ClaimCompass collect documents AFTER payment

**New approach:**
- Minimal friction before payment (conversion optimization)
- Documents collected post-payment (when user is committed)
- "Email later" option for maximum flexibility

### Discovery: Bank Details Timing

**Previous assumption:** Collect bank details during payment flow

**Reality:** Airlines pay compensation directly, not through us

**Competitive best practice:** Collect bank details AFTER airline approves claim (4-8 weeks)

**Impact:** Remove bank details from payment flow entirely

### Technical Decision: Idempotency

**Problem:** Users clicking "Pay" multiple times caused duplicate charges

**Solution:** Implemented at two levels:
1. **Client-side:** `hasSubmitted` state prevents double-clicks
2. **Server-side:** Idempotency keys in Stripe API calls

**Result:** Zero duplicate payments possible
