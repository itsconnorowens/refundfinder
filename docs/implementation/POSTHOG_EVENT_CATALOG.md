## Event Testing Guide

### How to Test Events Locally

PostHog is currently **disabled in development** (see `PostHogProvider.tsx:28`). To test events:

**Option 1: Enable in Development**
```typescript
// src/components/PostHogProvider.tsx
loaded: (posthog) => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    // posthog.opt_out_capturing();  // Comment this out
  }
},
```

**Option 2: Test in Production/Staging**
Deploy to a staging environment and use PostHog's live events debugger.

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Eligibility Check (Flight)**
  - [ ] `eligibility_check_started` fires on form submit
  - [ ] `eligibility_check_completed` fires with eligible result
  - [ ] `file_claim_clicked` fires on "Proceed with Claim" click

- [ ] **Eligibility Check (Email)**
  - [ ] `eligibility_check_started` fires with method='email'
  - [ ] `eligibility_check_completed` fires with eligible result

- [ ] **Claim Form**
  - [ ] `claim_form_started` fires on page load
  - [ ] `claim_step_completed` fires for each of 6 steps
  - [ ] `claim_form_abandoned` fires on page leave (after 10+ seconds)

- [ ] **Documents**
  - [ ] `document_uploaded` fires for boarding pass upload
  - [ ] `document_uploaded` fires for delay proof upload
  - [ ] `form_error_occurred` fires on upload error

- [ ] **Payment**
  - [ ] `payment_initiated` fires when payment intent created
  - [ ] `payment_completed` fires on successful payment

### Using PostHog Console

```javascript
// In browser console, check if PostHog is loaded
console.log(window.posthog)

// Manually trigger a test event
posthog.capture('test_event', { test: true })

// Check recent events
posthog.get_property('$initial_referrer')
```

## Best Practices

### Event Naming
- ✅ Use snake_case
- ✅ Use past tense
- ✅ Be specific and descriptive
- ✅ Include object and action
- ❌ Don't use abbreviations
- ❌ Don't use generic names like "click" or "submit"

### Event Properties
- ✅ Include relevant context (IDs, amounts, types)
- ✅ Use consistent property names across events
- ✅ Include error messages for debugging
- ✅ Use clear, descriptive property names
- ❌ Don't include PII (personally identifiable information) except user IDs
- ❌ Don't include sensitive data (passwords, tokens, full card numbers)

### When to Track
- ✅ Track user actions (clicks, submits)
- ✅ Track state changes (step completed, status changed)
- ✅ Track successes AND failures
- ✅ Track timing for UX optimization
- ❌ Don't track on every render
- ❌ Don't track internal state changes
- ❌ Don't spam events

### Performance
- ✅ Use `typeof window !== 'undefined'` check
- ✅ Track after action completes, not before
- ✅ Keep property objects lightweight
- ❌ Don't block UI for tracking
- ❌ Don't track in tight loops

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Showing in PostHog

**Problem:** Events not appearing in PostHog dashboard

**Solutions:**
1. Check that PostHog is not opted out in development
2. Verify PostHog API key is set correctly
3. Check browser console for PostHog errors
4. Verify reverse proxy `/ingest` route is working
5. Check PostHog project settings for event filtering

### Events Duplicating

**Problem:** Same event tracked multiple times

**Solutions:**
1. Check for multiple event captures in code
2. Verify component isn't re-rendering unnecessarily
3. Check useEffect dependencies
4. Use PostHog's automatic deduplication

### Missing Properties

**Problem:** Events tracked but properties are undefined

**Solutions:**
1. Verify data exists before capturing event
2. Check variable scope and timing
3. Add defensive checks (optional chaining)
4. Log properties before capturing for debugging
