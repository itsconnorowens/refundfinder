## Troubleshooting Guide

### Events Not Appearing

**Problem**: Events not showing up in PostHog

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify PostHog API key in `.env.local`
3. Check network tab for failed POST requests to `/ingest`
4. Wait 1-2 minutes (events are batched)
5. Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Feature Flags Not Working

**Problem**: Feature flag not changing behavior

**Solutions**:
1. Check flag exists in PostHog UI
2. Verify flag key matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check for JavaScript errors
5. Verify `/decide` API call in network tab

### Session Recordings Missing

**Problem**: No recordings appear

**Solutions**:
1. Check PostHog project settings â†’ Recordings enabled
2. Verify ad blocker isn't blocking PostHog
3. Check console for recording errors
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for processing

### Group Analytics Not Working

**Problem**: Groups not appearing

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `posthog.group()` called before events
2. Check group type exists in PostHog settings
3. Ensure `$groups` in event properties
